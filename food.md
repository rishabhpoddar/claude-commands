# Claude Command: Personal diet management

The purpose of this command is to help me manage my personal diet goals.

## High level plan
There is a repo here on this machine: `/Users/rishabhpoddar/Desktop/trythisapp/diet`. It contains a json database, some scripts and a readme.md file. Using this, you should be able to answer / perform any queries asked by the user.

## What to do
1. Read the readme here: `/Users/rishabhpoddar/Desktop/trythisapp/diet/README.md`
2. Now do what the user wants based on this query: "$ARGUMENTS". Be concise and to the point.
3. If the state of the repo has changed in any way, then git add, commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
