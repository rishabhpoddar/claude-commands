# Claude Command: Commit, add to work log, and push to git

This command is used to commit and push the changes to the remote repository.

## What to do
1. Call the /gc command to commit the changes. You MUST use this command to commit the changes and NOT do it on your own using git cli. That is because this command will commit and also add the changes to a work log.
2. Call the git push command to push the changes to the remote repository. If a new branch needs to be created on remote, then do so.
